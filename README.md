# Data
The data for this comes from Ideas RePEc. (more coming soon)

It looks at the rankings of economics departments based off some custom metrics.

# Project
I am interested in looking at how departments are ranked in some of my fields of interest relative to their overall ranking.

"rank_diff" is the column by which the data/{emphasis}_overperformers.csv_ are sorted

where rank_diff = department_overall_rank - department_{emphasis}_rank

so the greater the rank_diff, the more specialized the school is in that {emphasis}, in theory.

This is just an intial way to find potential programs that I would not have considered without looking at every department's faculty's publications.
